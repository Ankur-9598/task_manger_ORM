Here I'm extending the functionality of the project I worked in [Django_Task_Manager](https://github.com/Ankur-9598/django_task_manager)

The specification for this program is as follows,

## Specification

You are asked to build the same project we worked on in the [Django_Task_Manager](https://github.com/Ankur-9598/django_task_manager) and add database for storing the tasks instead of using server memory.

This milestone should be implemented with the Django ORM.

> Note: Please make sure your URL patterns have a trailing slash to pass the tests.

## Running locally

To install the requirements for this project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Before starting the server make sure to migrate the database changes.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Testing

Run the following command to test your application.

```bash
python manage.py test
```
